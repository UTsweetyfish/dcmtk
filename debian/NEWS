dcmtk (3.6.1~20150924-1) UNRELEASED: urgency=medium 

  With this new snapshot upstream removed the  wwwapps tools and 
  perl scripts that were developed for the CAR 1996 modality showcase, and 
  that are largely unused and unsupported. 

dcmtk (3.6.1~20150629-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  Version 3.6.1 has compatible change of the index.dat format that is not
  backward compatible, and the current dcmtk is trashing the memory (one
  byte of) when using dcmqrscp.  All files in
  
    /var/lib/dcmtk/*/index.dat
  
  that are create with version 3.6.0 or before will be corrupted and
  users need to reconstruct the db.
  
  The interested user might like to inspect the upstream commit
